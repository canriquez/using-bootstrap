## Key points to highlight: 
The following media breaks represent a key CSS responsiveness detail in the page design:

- 991px media
Column-4 contains:
   > Column 1 ('Top-Story', 'Culture an Travel' and 'More Stories' subsections)
   > Column 2 ('Featured Stories', 'sponsored Insights')
Column-3 contains: 'Opinion", 'Latest News', 'Sponsored Insights', 'Sign Up' and some more 'Sponsored Insights.
- On media <992, Columns structure changes To the following: 
    > Column 4 is placed on 100% of the viewport with Column 2 on 45% and Column 1 55% of that viewport. Article order and structure remain the same.
        - Column 2 ('Featured Stories', 'sponsored Insights') - To the left of view port.
        - Column 1 ('Top-Story', 'Culture an Travel' and 'More Stories' subsections)
    > Column 3 locates now wrapping below column 4 with the same order in articles
    > Column-3 contains: 'Opinion", 'Latest News', 'Sponsored Insights', 'Sign Up' and some more 'Sponsored Insights.
- On media <768, Columns structure changes and becomes a single page column 
    > Column 4 goes on top position, but now Column 1 and 2 are shown on 100% viewport wrapping on top of each other.
    > Column 1, this time, goes first with a change in sub-columns order: ('Top-Story,' 'More Stories', and then 'Culture and Travel.'
    > Column 2, wraps below showing  'Featured Stories' and then 'sponsored Insights.'
    > Column 3 comes last with the same order: 'Opinion", 'Latest News,' 'Sponsored Insights,' 'Sign Up', and some more 'Sponsored Insights.
